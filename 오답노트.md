A company is developing an application that will be accessed through the Amazon API Gateway REST API. Registered users should be the only ones who can access certain resources of this API. The token being used should expire automatically and needs to be refreshed periodically.

How can a Developer meet these requirements?

A
Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool, configure the Amazon Cognito Authorizer in API Gateway, and use the temporary credentials generated by the identity pool.

B
Create and maintain a database record for each user with a corresponding token and use an AWS Lambda authorizer in API Gateway.

C
Create an Amazon Cognito user pool, configure the Cognito Authorizer in API Gateway, and use the identity or access token.

D
Create an IAM user for each API user, attach an invoke permissions policy to the API, and use an IAM authorizer in API Gateway.

Cognito User Pool이 적합한 이유:

- 사용자 등록/인증 관리 기능 제공
- JWT 토큰 기반 인증 제공
- 토큰 자동 만료 및 갱신 기능 내장
- API Gateway와 통합이 쉬움
  다른 옵션이 부적절한 이유:
  A (Identity Pool):
- 임시 AWS 자격 증명을 제공하는 것이 주 목적
- 사용자 인증보다는 AWS 서비스 접근 권한 관리에 적합

Server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C)

C
Server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed keys (SSE-KMS)

D

### 6

When a Simple Queue Service message triggers a task that takes 5 minutes to complete, which process below will result in successful processing of the message and remove it from the queue while minimizing the chances of duplicate processing?

A
Retrieve the message with an increased visibility timeout, process the message, delete the message from the queue

B
Retrieve the message with an increased visibility timeout, delete the message from the queue, process the message

C
Retrieve the message with increased DelaySeconds, process the message, delete the message from the queue

D
Retrieve the message with increased DelaySeconds, delete the message from the queue, process the message

Visibility Timeout의 역할

- 메시지가 처리되는 동안 다른 소비자가 같은 메시지를 처리하지 못하도록 막는 시간
- 기본값은 30초이지만, 작업 시간이 5분이므로 증가된 visibility timeout이 필요함

DelaySeconds

- 메시지를 큐에 처음 넣을 때 적용되는 설정
- 새로운 메시지의 초기 "숨김" 기간을 설정
